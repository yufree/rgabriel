Description: Analyze multi-level one-way
        experimental designs where there are unequal sample
        sizes and population variance homogeneity can not be assumed.
        To conduct the Gabriel test <doi:10.2307/2286265>, create two vectors: one for your 
        observations and one for the factor level of each observation. 
        The function, rgabriel, conduct the test and save the output as
        a vector to input into the gabriel.plot function, which produces 
        a confidence interval plot for Multiple Comparison.
