Description: This package was created to analyze multi-level one-way
        experimental designs. It is designed to handle vectorized
        observation and factor data where there are unequal sample
        sizes and population variance homogeneity can not be assumed.
        To conduct the Gabriel test, create two vectors: one for your 
        observations and one for the factor level of each observation. 
        The function, rgabriel, conduct the test and save the output as
        a vector to input into the gabriel.plot function, which produces 
        a confidence interval plot for Multiple Comparison.
